# Enterprise Lakehouse & ML Platform Architecture on Azure Databricks

This repository demonstrates the design and implementation of a production-oriented Lakehouse and Machine Learning platform built on Azure Databricks.

The implementation covers:

- Delta Lakehouse architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Auto Loader streaming ingestion with schema evolution
- Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline orchestration
- Unity Catalog governance and access controls
- Job orchestration and scheduling
- SQL analytics layer for consumption
- MLflow experiment tracking and model lifecycle management
- CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions

The repository is structured to reflect architectural domains rather than lab exercises.
