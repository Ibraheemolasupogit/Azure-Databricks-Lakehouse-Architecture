# Databricks Lakehouse Workflows – Overview

This repo groups a set of hands-on workflows to exercise key patterns:

## 1. Data Lakehouse & Engineering

- Explore and transform data with Apache Spark
- Use Delta Lake for reliable batch and streaming pipelines
- Build Bronze / Silver / Gold tables
- Optimise pipelines for performance and cost

## 2. Machine Learning & MLOps

- Train models with MLflow and AutoML
- Track experiments and manage model versions
- Deploy models to production pipelines

## 3. Generative AI & LLMOps

- Explore large language models in Azure Databricks
- Build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows
- Implement responsible AI patterns for LLMs

## 4. Real-Time Analytics & Streaming

- Real-time data processing with Spark Structured Streaming
- End-to-end streaming pipelines with Delta Live Tables (or Lakeflow)
- Deploy streaming workloads as production jobs
